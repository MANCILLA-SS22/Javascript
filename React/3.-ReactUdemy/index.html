  The public/ Folder
  As shown in the previous lecture you can store images in the public/ folder and then directly reference them from inside your index.html or index.css files.
  The reason for that is that images (or, in general: files) stored in public/ are made publicly available by the underlying project development server & build process. 
  Just like index.html, those files can directly be visited from inside the browser and can therefore also be requested by other files. 
  If you try loading localhost:5173/some-image.jpg, you'll be able to see that image (if it exists in the public/ folder, of course).

  The src/assets/ Folder
  You can also store images in the src/assets/ folder (or, actually, anywhere in the src folder). So what's the difference compared to public/?
  Any files (of any format) stored in src (or subfolders like src/assets/) are not made available to the public. They can't be accessed by website visitors. If you 
  try loading localhost:5173/src/assets/some-image.jpg, you'll get an error. Instead, files stored in src/ (and subfolders) can be used in your code files. 
  Images imported into code files are then picked up by the underlying build process, potentially optimized, and kind of "injected" into the public/ folder right 
  before serving the website. Links to those images are automatically generated and used in the places where you referenced the imported images.

  Which Folder Should You Use?
  You should use the public/ folder for any images that should not be handled by the build process and that should be generally available. Good candidates are images 
  used directly in the index.html file or favicons. On the other hand, images that are used inside of components should typically be stored in the src/ folder (e.g., in src/assets/).
